# 0) JobSync .env Setup Instructions
# NOTE: An .env (environment) file is used to configure the JobSync application, 
#       including database connection, authentication, API keys, and other settings.
# HOW TO CONFIGURE:
# 1. Save this .env.example file in the root of the project 
#    as .env file (without the .example extension). 
#    Hint: Linux/MacOS users can run from the terminal  
#          cp .env.example .env
# 2. Open the .env file in a text editor and edit the variables 
#    as needed based on the instructions below each variable.


# 1) Database configuration:
# NOTE: Remove "#" before DATABASE_URL below

#       For *local development/use*, change DATABASE_URL to
#       "file:./dev.db" 
#       and run
#       npx prisma migrate dev --name init
#       which will create a SQLite database named dev.db 
#       based on the Prisma schema defined in the project.

#       For *production/homelab server use*, change DATABASE_URL to
#       match your server IP/Port requirement, for example: 
#       http://192.168.x.x:5432
# DATABASE_URL=file:"./dev.db"

# 2) Login Credentials for the JobSync application:
# Change your user email and password below
USER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
USER_PASSWORD=password123

# 3) Timezone Configuration:
# If you are running it on a remote server/homelab, 
# you must update timezone otherwise activities times may shift.
# Find your TZ (timezone) identifier here: 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List
TZ=America/Edmonton

# 4) Authentication Configuration:
# NOTE: Optional step for local use, 
#       but recommended for production/homelab server use.
# HOW TO CONFIGURE:
# 1. Open up your Linux/MacOS terminal 
#    OR use an online generator like 
#    https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto/openssl/
# 2. Run the following command to generate a random 32-byte base64 string:
#    openssl rand -base64 32
# 3. Copy the generated string and paste it in the AUTH_SECRET variable below.
AUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64

# 5) Accessing JobSync:
# NOTE: For homelab server, customize NEXTAUTH_URL 
#       to match your server IP/Port requirement, for example: 
#       http://192.168.x.x:3000
#       For local development, use 
#       http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true


# 6) API Keys Configuration
## 6.1) LLM API Keys/Endpoints:
# NOTE: The system supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama).
#       The system uses LLM-based semantic extraction for intelligent, context-aware skill matching.
#       Semantic extraction is the default (no further configuration needed for that).
# HOW TO CONFIGURE:
#       1. Provide API Key/Endpoints below 
#       2. run JobSync and open the app using your NEXTAUTH_URL 
#       3. open the settings page /dashboard/settings 
#       4. select your AI Service Provider and Model

### OpenAI API Key

### DeepSeek API Key 
#   Get your API Key from https://platform.deepseek.com
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-api-key-here

### OLLAMA
# NOTE: For homelab server, if you ollama is running on server, 
#       change the following to your ollamma IP/Port ex: 
#       http://192.168.x.x:12345
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
